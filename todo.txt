when filtering words, should also search within related words
make the highlights show up on every word and website
be able to add spaces to words like 이 so it only gets highlighted when it is by itself, not in a word
seperate the highlights so that you can see the seperation even when two highlighted words are next to eachother
make it so that words can be grouped together to make sentences in the list.
should have base words, even 는, 에, 가, that can be added together to make sentences
incentivise making longer sentences of known words
